        I’ve been thinking about that day for so long.
        I just wanted to say sorry for ruining it and wasting your time, and for making it irritating.
        I’ve never met a girl like you—not just your beauty, but your personality, gestures, and everything else. You’re just amazing.
        And on the other side... I messed everything up. But believe me, that wasn’t me. I don’t know what happened that day. There were reasons, but I don’t want to make excuses.
        You understood it all so calmly, and I really admire that.
        You didn’t deserve the awkwardness or the mess I brought into the moment—I let things slip, and that’s on me.
        I genuinely wanted to spend time with you and get to know you better, and I hate that it ended up feeling off.
        But I care about how you felt, and I really hope we can start fresh—even if it’s just a good conversation to clear the air.
        No pressure—I just wanted to be real with you and say I’m sorry.
        Though I wanted to ask you out, but one try!! Mistakes happen from humans after all, so will you?
