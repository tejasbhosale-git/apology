        For a very long time, I always wanted to have a fancy dinner at some cozy resto and taste the ice cream from Rustom's while seeing the view of Marine Lines—but I never found the right girl. And now that I finally got one, I messed up. On our date, you paid, which was so embarrassing. Of course, there was a reason, but still...

        I wanted to pay you back, but it would’ve felt cheap. So, to cover it up—how about we recreate that scene?<br>
        Don’t worry, no f-ups this time.<br>
        I’m a human who makes mistakes, not a donkey repeating them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though, it’s your call...<br>
        Wanna plan?
